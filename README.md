# Serbian Short Stories

This is a repository of short stories written in serbian that learners can use in conjunction with the [Lute](https://luteorg.github.io/lute-manual/intro.html) software. All stories included are written in cyrllic and not the latin script.

All stories were legally obtained and are either within the public domain or registered under a creative commons license. None of these stories were written or developed by me.
